# pydemic

Pydemic is a simple Python project to clean, analyze and predict epidemic data. It also generates synthetic data from custom SEIRD models.
There's a module to estimate the CFR of an outbreak using different methods. 
The resolution delay distributions (i.e. distribution of time from disease onset to death or to recovery) are estimated using the [skopt](https://github.com/scikit-optimize/scikit-optimize) optimization library

## TO-DO:

  - [ ] Add use-case documentation
  - [ ] Transform into a Python package
